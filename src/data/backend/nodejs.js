      question: "What is Node.js and how does it work?",
      answer: "Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on the V8 engine not a language. It allows you to run JavaScript on the server Like we have JVM for Spring. We can run our .js file directly in node environment. We do not need any additional setup ."
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      question: "How Node is a runtime environment on server side? What is V8?",
      answer: "Browser excute code in client side (Browser has APIs to run JS code) while Node excute code in server (Node have APIs like File System, HTTP, etc.). Both Browser and Node have V8 engine but Node have additional features like event loop, APIs etc. V8 is a JavaScript engine which is written in C++. It compiles and runs JavaScript code ."

      question: "What is the difference between Runtime environment & Framework?",
      answer: "Runtime environment is a software that provides an environment for a program to run like memory mangement and I/O operations. Framework is a collection of libraries and tools that helps you to build a web application and it is built on top of runtime environment. Like React is a framework built on top of browser runtime environment. Express is a framework built on top of node runtime environment. In short Runtime environment provides features while framework provides features to build an application."

      id:4,
      question:"What is the difference between Node.js & Express.js??",
      answer:"NodeJS is runtime environment while Express.js is a framework.Express.js is built on top of NodeJS. Node.js provides features like file system, http, etc. while Express.js provides features like routing, middleware, etc."
    },{
      id:5,
      question:"What are the differences between Client-Side(Browser) & Server-Side(Node.js)?",
      answer:"Server-Side handles the bussiness logic like database, Authentication, API, etc. While client side handles the UI it has feature like DOM Manipulation, Event Handling, etc. "

      question:"What are the 7 Main Features of Node.js?",

    },{
      id:7,
      question:"What is Asynchronous Programming?",
      answer:"A task will not wait for another task to complete. It will just move to the next task and will come back to the previous task once it is completed. This is called non-blocking nature of node.js and event will tell the thread the task is completed and excute it first. "
    },{
      id:8,
      question:"What are Events Event Emitter, Event Queue, Event Loop & Event Driven?",
      answer:"Node.js follows event driven architecture. It have Event Emitter to emit events, Event Queue to queue events, Event Loop to loop through events and Event Driven to drive events. Event Driven architecture is nothing but a way to handle events. "

      question:"What are Modules in Node? What is the difference between a function & module",
      answer:"Modules in node are nothing but a way to organize our code in a way that we can reuse it. It is a way to break down our code into smaller manageable chunks. Function returns a value (one) while module can export multiple values/functions/classes etc.A module is a broader concept that encapsulates functionality, while a function is a specific set of instructions within that module.

      answer:"1. Routing (Easy to define routes and endpoints)  2.Middleware (Chainable functions that can process requests and responses)  3.Template Engines (Integration with template engines like EJS, Pug, etc.)  4.Error Handling (Efficient error handling middleware)  5.Security (Built-in security features like helmet, rate limiting, etc.)  6.Performance (Lightweight and fast framework)  7.Community (Large and active community with extensive support and resources)"

      question:"What is Middleware in Express.js and when to use them?",
      answer:"Middleware is a function that stands in between request and response and can perform validation, modification, etc. We use them when we need to perform some action before or after the request is processed."
    },{
      id:17,
      question:"What are the types of Middleware?",
      answer:"1. Application-level middleware (app.use())  2.Router-level middleware (router.use())  3.Error-handling middleware (err, req, res, next)  4.Built-in middleware (express.json(), express.urlencoded())  5.Third-party middleware (body-parser, cors, helmet, etc.)"

    },{
      id:21,
      question:"What is error handling middleware?",
      answer:"Error handling middleware is a middleware that is used to handle errors in our application. It is a function that takes four arguments req, res, err, next. And we add then at the end if we have multiple middlewares so if the error occure in any middleware it will skip all the remaining middleware and go to the error handling middleware.",
